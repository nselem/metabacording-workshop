	abstract = {We are bioinformatics trainees at the University of Michigan who started a local chapter of Girls Who Code to provide a fun and supportive environment for high school women to learn the power of coding. Our goal was to cover basic coding topics and data science concepts through live coding and hands-on practice. However, we could not find a resource that exactly met our needs. Therefore, over the past three years, we have developed a curriculum and instructional format using Jupyter notebooks to effectively teach introductory Python for data science. This method, inspired by The Carpentries organization, uses bite-sized lessons followed by independent practice time to reinforce coding concepts, and culminates in a data science capstone project using real-world data. We believe our open curriculum is a valuable resource to the wider education community and hope that educators will use and improve our lessons, practice problems, and teaching best practices. Anyone can contribute to our educational materials on {GitHub}.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Inspired by well-established material and pedagogy provided by The Carpentries (Wilson 2016), we developed a two-day workshop curriculum that teaches introductory R programming for managing, analyzing, plotting and reporting data using packages from the tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019), the Unix shell, version control with git, and {GitHub}. While the official Software Carpentry curriculum is comprehensive, we found that it contains too much content for a two-day workshop. We also felt that the independent nature of the lessons left learners confused about how to integrate the newly acquired programming skills in their own work. Thus, we developed a new curriculum that aims to teach novices how to implement reproducible research principles in their own data analysis. The curriculum integrates live coding lessons with individual-level and group-based practice exercises, and also serves as a succinct resource that learners can reference both during and after the workshop. Moreover, it lowers the entry barrier for new instructors as they do not have to develop their own teaching materials or sift through extensive content. We developed this curriculum during a two-day sprint, successfully used it to host a two-day virtual workshop with almost 40 participants, and updated the material based on instructor and learner feedback. We hope that our new curriculum will prove useful to future instructors interested in teaching workshops with similar learning objectives.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.},

We analyzed the role of these traits in mediating the responses of a planktonic microbial community to nutrient enrichment in an oligotrophic, phosphorus-deficient pond in Cuatro Ci√©negas, Mexico. This is one of the first whole-ecosystem experiments to involve replicated metagenomic assessment. Mean bacterial genome size, {GC} content, total number of {tRNA} genes, total number of {rRNA} genes, and codon usage bias in ribosomal protein sequences were all higher in the fertilized treatment, as predicted on the basis of the assumption that oligotrophy favors lower information-processing costs whereas copiotrophy favors higher processing rates. Contrasting changes in trait variances also suggested differences between traits in mediating assembly under copiotrophic versus oligotrophic conditions. Trade-offs in information-processing traits are apparently sufficiently pronounced to play a role in community assembly because the major components of metabolism‚Äîinformation, energy, and nutrient requirements‚Äîare fine-tuned to an organism‚Äôs growth and trophic strategy.},
